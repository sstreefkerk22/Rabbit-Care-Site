### Who to Contact in an Emergency?

First rule of thumb -- trust your veterianarians, but know your facts. Rabbits are considered exotic animals in the world of veterinarian science. You cannot just show up to any vet office and receive service. You must know ahead of time which offices service small animals. On top of this many places have specific days where they service small animals. Ensure you know ahead of time office hours, small animal veterinarian availability, and which emergency 24hour clinics service small animals.

Save office phone numbers to your mobile phone so they are readily available in a crisis and it is one less thing you have to worry about.

Know signs of statis in rabbits and do your research on what to look for ahead of time. The earlier you catch this problem, the faster you can get them to your trusted veterinarian to save their life.
