## Our Goal!
We want all Bun Moms to be confident in the care they provide their fur-babies. Resources for dogs and cats are ABUNDANT to say the least, so adopting a rabbit can feel lonely and overwhelming. Our goal is to change that! 

Currently, the most help you will get in a pet store is directions to the small animal isle and the price for a rabbit cage. Newsflash though: those cages are anything but appropriate for your rabbit. 

So what do you do next? Our recommendation...discard all you think you know, and disregard the instructions from your pet stores about rabbit cages. Use our site as a base for your ever-growing knowledge and don't forget to share what you've learned with other aspiring bun parents.
